## An Exploration of Optimisation Techniques for Vulkan-based Particle Systems

Part of the body of work for my final year at NUA studying Games Development BSc.

View the short research proposal for the project [here](https://github.com/RobinWragg/ParticleSystemsInVulkan/blob/master/proposal/proposal.pdf).

You can run the (unfinished) demo at code/x64/Debug/VulkanParticleSystem.exe.
